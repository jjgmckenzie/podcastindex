# Podcast Index

## About

A fully typed idiomatic go library to work with  [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/). Documented, Tested, including integration tests. Requires Podcast Index API key and secret.

Seeks to fully implement the API, while standardizing some quirks (eg having booleans occasionally be integers), and using types wherever possible (eg using time.Time instead of unix integers & url.URL instead of strings.)

Wherever possible, guarantees* compatibility & symmetry (i.e. marshal -> unmarshal produces the same JSON as an API query). 

Also raises console warnings/fixes queries when undocumented issues are hit up against in the API (e.g. [max value documented as 1000, but actually 99](./search_podcast_by_title.go#L39)))

(*Minor asymmetry excluded: [Language tags](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/docs-api/issues/142))

### Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/jjgmckenzie/podcastindex"
)

func main() {
	key := "<YOUR KEY>"
	secret := "<YOUR SECRET>"
	userAgent := "<YOUR USER AGENT>"
	client := podcastindex.NewClient(podcastindex.NewClientOptions{
		UserAgent: userAgent,
		APIKey:    key,
		APISecret: secret,
	})
	ctx := context.Background()
	podcasts := client.SearchPodcastsByTitle(ctx, "test", nil)
	for _, podcast := range podcasts {
		episodes := client.GetEpisodes(ctx, podcast, nil)
		for _, episode := range episodes {
			fmt.Printf("%s : %s\n", podcast.Title, episode.Title)
		}
	}
}
```


### API Coverage

See [API-COVERAGE.md](./API-COVERAGE.md) to see current API coverage by this library. Right now, the library is mostly limited to search, podcasts, and episodes.

If you'd like to contribute to this project by implementing more of the API endpoints such as Value4Value, please refer to the existing implementations as a guide for how to structure your code.

### Contributing

To run integration tests; create a .env file with the following variables.
```
PODCASTINDEX_API_KEY=<YOUR KEY>
PODCASTINDEX_API_SECRET=<YOUR KEY>
```
Please ensure all existing tests pass and that test coverage is full for any new feature/endpoint added.
